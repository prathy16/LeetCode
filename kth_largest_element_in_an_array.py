Problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/
Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

__Example 1:__
Input: [3,2,1,5,6,4] and k = 2
Output: 5

__Example 2:__
Input: [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6] and k = 4
Output: 4
Note: 
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ array's length.
